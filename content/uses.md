Some people are often puzzled about my setup or want to hear my recommendations for a given task. On this page, I will describe the tools I use to survive my day, accompanied with links for the readers to try them out. I keep this page updated as often as possible. That probably won't happen more often than every other year, but anyway...

The works of [**Wes Bos**](https://wesbos.com/uses/) inspired this page. If you decide to make your own `/uses` page after reading this, please include me among the sources.

## Office and Computer Hardware

I regularly work from home, so a functional office setup is something you shouldn't be a cheapskate about.

Therefore, I work with...

-   **MacBook Pro 2021** with M1 Max CPU and 64 GB RAM for all my personal and work needs.
-   [**Autonomous Standing Desk**](https://www.autonomous.ai/standing-desks/smartdesk-2-home) since getting up off my ass helps me stay more alert when feeling drowsy.
-   [**Samsung 27-inch WQHD**](https://www.samsung.com/fi/monitors/gaming/wqhd-curved-monitor-27-inch-lc27jg50qquxen/) curved monitor. I was surprised by how nice curved monitors are to look at.
-   [**Blue Yeti USB microphone**](https://www.bluemic.com/en-us/products/yeti/), since pair and ensemble programming require constant and clear communication. I sometimes visit podcasts too. It has a great physical mute button, and I can plug in my [**Bose QuietComfort 35**](https://www.bose.fi/fi_fi/products/headphones/over_ear_headphones/quietcomfort-35-wireless-ii.html) headphones via a 3.5mm jack for zero-latency audio feedback for my voice.
-   **Mozi AR-2 BaseStand** lifts my laptop to a comfortable height for my eyes, which helps with neck pain.
-   [**Keychron K8**](https://www.keychron.com/pages/keychron-k8-wireless-mechanical-keyboard) mechanical keyboard with brown switches and a satisfying tactile bump.
-   [**Logitech MX Master 3**](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/mx-master-3.910-005620.html) mouse with custom macros for taking, e.g. screenshots. Nearly all the other mice feel too tiny for my hands.
-   [**Amazon Kindle Paperwhite**](https://www.amazon.com/kindle/) for reading e-books, which I mostly strive to buy in DRM-free ePUB format.
-   [**Remarkable 2**](https://remarkable.com/) for handwriting notes and sketching confusing diagrams.

## Software

Although I am an open-source advocate, in most situations, I have no problem paying and using commercial software when it delivers the job. This will be a mouthful, so I'll list my used apps below. I've marked the apps I've purchased or subscribed to with a moneybag (üí∞) sign.

Most apps offer a limited free plan which you should check out too, if it covers your needs.

### Desktop Applications

-   [**Microsoft Edge**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge) for browsing the web. In the past, I've used Vivaldi and Safari, but there was always something off in the user experience. Edge is surprisingly stable.
-   [**IntelliJ IDEA** üí∞](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) for larger codebases that crave safe and automatic refactoring tools.
-   [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for general-purpose programming activities.
-   [**Raycast** üí∞](https://www.raycast.com/) to boost my productivity with a variety of workflows and snippets.
-   [**Cleanshot X** üí∞](https://cleanshot.com/) to capture screenshots and record videos. It's rather useful for reporting issues with websites.
-   [**MindNode** üí∞](https://mindnode.com) for drawing, exporting, and sharing mind maps. [**Miro**](https://miro.com/) covers the same need as well.
-   [**Obsidian** üí∞](https://obsidian.md) for writing notes, drafts, checklists, and keeping a personal journal around. I kick off each day with a daily journal page, including a to-do list for important tasks. Previously, I used **Notion** for this, but Obsidian is more simple with its pure local Markdown approach.
-   [**Insomnia**](https://insomnia.rest/) for testing REST, gRPC and GraphQL APIs.
-   [**TablePlus** üí∞](https://tableplus.io) for accessing relational databases, Redis caches, and more.
-   [**Todoist** üí∞](https://todoist.com) for reminding me to pay my monthly bills and a heap of other stuff.
-   [**Toggl**](https://toggl.com) for tracking the time spent on projects and tasks, which is a mandatory evil thing to do at work. I hope our country will someday remove the 7.5 hours working day requirement altogether.

### Terminal Applications

-   [**Neovim**](https://neovim.io/) with [**LazyVim**](https://www.lazyvim.org/) preset configuration for quick single-file edits and working with files over SSH.
-   [**Kitty**](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/), the GPU-powered terminal with [custom configuration](https://github.com/nikoheikkila/kitty) and a couple of startup sessions for different projects.
-   [**Friendly Interactive Shell (Fish)**](https://fishshell.com/) with the [**Oh-My-Fish**](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish) framework and the [**Starship**](https://starship.rs/) prompt customization.
-   [**Z**](https://github.com/rupa/z/) script to quickly jump to a project.
-   [**Fuzzy Finder (FZF)**](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) script to remember the exact command I typed a few hours ago.
-   [**LazyGit**](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/) for managing version control. Sometimes the native command line `git` just isn't enough.

### Web Services

-   [**1Password** üí∞](https://1password.com) with Business and Family subscriptions paid by my employer. I use it to store passwords, secure notes, software licenses, movie tickets, and SSH keys. It's the best password manager out there, and using anything else would cause me a mental breakdown.
-   [**DigitalOcean Spaces** üí∞](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces) to serve static assets to this blog and other purposes.
-   [**Dropbox** üí∞](https://www.dropbox.com) with a two-terabyte subscription to dump all my random things into.
-   [**HEY** üí∞](https://www.hey.com/), for the email. I didn't know I needed its powerful features until I screened out the first obnoxious marketer sending unsolicited sales emails.
-   [**Fastmail** üí∞](https://fastmail.com/) for using a custom domain as my email since HEY for Domains is, sadly, another product.
-   [**GitHub**](https://github.com/) for storing my code unless work projects require otherwise. I love [**Copilot**](https://github.com/features/copilot) ‚Äî which I have access to due to being a _popular_ open-source maintainer ‚Äî and it's the best invention since refactoring shortcuts; sue me freely.

In the end, I use too much everything so I've probably forgotten the most. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
