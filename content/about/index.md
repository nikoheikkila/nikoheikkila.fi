## Hello! ðŸ––

Thanks for visiting my site. Let me tell you a little bit about myself.

I'm a [software craftsman](/blog/death-of-the-production-line-and-factory-workers-attitude) with a strong passion for open source software and the latest technologies. For me, continuous learning and improvement of my skills is my greatest asset.

To this day, I've been working as tech support and journalist besides leading highly skilled development teams. My core skills are in web development, project management, and quality assurance.

I've been working with several backend frameworks from **Laravel** (PHP) and **Ruby on Rails** to simpler micro-platforms like **Flask** (Python) and **Express** (Javascript). As for the frontend, I consider the lovely world of Javascript and Typescript spiced with **React** or **Vue** a fertile ground where a majority of the future applications leverage. Keeping in mind the [_Atwood's Law_][atwood], if an application can be written in Javascript, it shall one day be written in it. Lately, I've also been getting familiar with **Go** and **Rust** for developing robust concurrent applications for data analysis.

I'm an obedient follower of **Continuous Integration and Delivery** (CI/CD) methodologies. I believe that having a stable automated testing and deployment pipeline from the first day of the project is its greatest future asset radically shortening the time-to-market and increasing customer value. Bundling this approach with cloud technologies like **Docker** or **Serverless**, you'll have a battle-hardened portable solution ready to drop into any an environment quickly.

Furthermore, I've participated in organising events and seminars. I have a very systemic approach to project management methodologies. Thanks to modern tools like **Trello**, **Jira**, and **Slack**, I can coordinate even large projects, whether working remotely or in office.

Apart from coding, I keep my skills refreshed by reading and writing. I've interviewed experienced people about their work and helped the little ones to reach the audience. On my spare time, I write my ruminations in this blog. Naturally, as an impeccable geek, you can find me on the premiere of the next epic Marvel production -- although I won't refuse a discussion about artsy cinema and literature either.

Yet Iâ€™m more than the letters you see so donâ€™t hesitate to connect with me for any questions. Let's close this with my favourite quote.
