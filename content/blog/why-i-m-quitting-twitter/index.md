Recently I ended a long relationship with _Twitter_, and I'm relieved.

For over 10 years I've written to a platform for which the experience, safety, and justice of users is irrelevant. For reasons well understood, people can't stop using it and arguing about how to use it. This is a product that never improves, that defends harmful content, and makes people unhappy. But there is money in it. A lot of money. In fact, their entire business depends on users but they never listen to them. I knew it wasn't good for me but I couldn't stop either.

When a new wave of federated social networks (or "fediverse") spearheaded by _[Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org)_ solidified itself, I saw my chance to be someone who could live a better life online. Because I know the platform I'm contributing to won't be actively destroying other people's lives. Unlike Twitter, Mastodon instances are built and moderated _by_ users _for_ users without business incentives which makes them better in every way.

So as of today, I will no longer update my Twitter account. It's going to be hard and I might have regrets which means I won't delete my account yet. Instead, I've set up a [_cross-posting_ bridge](https://crossposter.masto.donte.com.br/) from my English Mastodon account to Twitter. Don't bother replying to me because I won't be logging in to check my mentions anymore.

If you're interested in my content, here's a list of social accounts I'm still active in addition to this blog:

-   [_DEV.to_](https://dev.to/nikoheikkila) for my longer posts of which most appear on this blog as well.
-   [_Instagram_](https://www.instagram.com/nikoheikkila/) for all the photos I take until I figure out a better place to host them.
-   [_mastodon.technology_](https://mastodon.technology/@nikoheikkila) for my short posts in English.
-   [_mastodontti.fi_](https://mastodontti.fi/@nikoheikkila) for my short posts in Finnish.

I'm also on _Facebook_ and _LinkedIn_. However, those accounts are more restricted, so if I have no idea who you are I'm going to decline your request. I welcome you to follow me on the sites above because I'm certain my best content is still ahead of me.

Yours Sincerely,

_P.S. This is not as dramatic a decision as it reads. I'm only channeling my inner Don Draper._
