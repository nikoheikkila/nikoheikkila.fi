**Donald Trump** was vowed to the presidency of the United States on 20th of January this year and during these two weeks, they have caused what can fairly be stated as genuine havoc. Most notorious among these unfortunate events, depending on what media you have chosen to follow, must be the infamous [Muslim Ban][1]. Why yes, it's a ban, and frankly Obama administration had [entirely a different case][2] in their hands.

While Trump and their administration might lack skills and knowledge or, then again, they could be a manifestation [pure evil][3], I recalled another tyrant who reigned long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. Fortunately, they were not as real as Trump is.

[_Declaration of Rebellion_][4] is a direct letter published in _The Star Wars: Rebel Alliance Sourcebook_ (1990). I wonder if it would sound familiar if Mon Mothma and the Rebel Alliance had addressed their letter to Donald Trump instead of Emperor Palpatine?

Let's find out by replacing some of the keywords…

**We**, the beings of the Rebel Alliance, do this day send forth this Declaration to His Majesty, Donald Trump, and to all sentient beings in the world, to make clear to all the Purposes and Goals of this Rebellion.

**We** firmly acknowledge the importance and necessity of the institution of the American Government. We accept that all must subjugate themselves to that Government, giving up certain rights and freedoms, in return for peace, prosperity, and happiness for all.

**We** believe that the American Government derives its power and a right to rule from the consent of the governed. We believe that, should the rights of free beings be willfully and malignantly usurped, it is the unalienable right of said beings to alter or abolish said Government.

**We** believe that the American Empire has willfully and malignantly usurped the rights of the free beings of the world and therefore, it is our unalienable right to abolish it from the world.

**We** do not take this course lightly. Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes, but when a Government displays a history of usurpation, abuse, and moral atrocity, displaying a clear design to subjugate totally and absolutely beings born free under the auspices of nature, it is our right, our duty, to depose of that Government.

The history of the present American Empire is of repeated injuries upon its members, with the direct objective of establishing you, Emperor Trump, as the absolute tyrant over the world.

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <em>You have disbanded the Congress, the voice of the people;</em><br /> <em> You have instituted a policy of blatant racism and genocide against the non-Christian peoples of the world;</em><br /> <em> You have overthrown the chosen leaders of countries, replacing them with Bannons and Governors of your choice;</em><br /> <em> You have raised taxes without the consent of those taxed;</em><br /> <em> You have murdered and imprisoned millions without benefit of trial;</em><br /> <em> You have unlawfully taken land and property;</em><br /> <em> You have expanded the military far beyond what is necessary and prudent, for the sole purpose of oppressing your subjects.</em>
</p>

**We**, the Rebel Alliance, do therefore in the name, and by the authority, of the free beings of the world, solemnly publish and declare our intentions:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <em>To fight and oppose you and your forces, by any and all means at our disposal;</em><br /> <em> To refuse any American law contrary to the rights of free beings;</em><br /> <em> To bring about your destruction and the destruction of the American Empire;</em><br /> <em> To make forever free all beings in the galaxy.</em>
</p>

To these ends, we pledge our property, our honor, and our lives.
