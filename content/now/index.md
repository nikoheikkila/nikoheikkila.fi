This is my `/now` page intended to keep you -- and perhaps myself -- in the loop with my life. I can't fathom how to pull out a list like this accurately since I'm continually changing, but let me at least provide a bird's eye on my current life activities.

I've never strongly believed in people having two lives: work and personal. For me, these are all part of my essence with established boundaries in-between. Sure, those boundaries may overlap and leak a bit, but not in a way that would harm one another. Therefore, I present these findings as they are: life at work, at home, and what is left between them.

## Work

In 2020, I realized my current work at **Paytrail** would be churning the same lines of PHP code every day without meaningful sensations of challenge and reward. While the company itself and its staff are great, I felt my career there had hit a wall. Hence, it was in my best interests to resign and start fulfilling my ambitions on creating engaging digital services.

That's where my new employer, **Futurice**, walked into the picture. Besides working with their clientele, I aim to help them in their internal efforts which include plenty of open-source projects. Crafting experiences that improve life has always been a core aspect of my software craftsman attitude and given an opportunity to co-create the future with modern technologies in a low-level hierarchy is the place for me.

## In-Between

Continuously educating myself and improving my skills is the shit. I spend considerable time in reading books which have mostly been non-fiction lately. Check out my [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/nikoheikkila) page for those.

As for programming, I've recently been investing a lot of time on building static [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) websites with React and Vue (this blog is one example). I've always been more of a backend developer on a quest to become a full-stack developer. On the backend, I've slowly been adapting the tenets of safe programming with Golang and Rust to my toolbelt. I hope I have more time to maintain larger open-source projects and libraries in the future.

Despite my introvert nature, I've started attending software development meetups and networking events. Perhaps I'll see you there.

## Personal Life

I'm living in **Finland** (as of late 2020 in Tampere region, to be precise) with my partner in life. The Summer of COVID-19 didn't put too heavy a stress on me since I'm a natural introvert and a competent remote worker. Anyway, it's nice to go and eat in restaurants instead of ordering take-away and occasionally see people. Keep your distance, though!

I attempt to be the best ally and champion for diversity and equal rights. When I say attempt, I realize my numerous privileges given to me when I was born a white man on a European soil make me insensitive to several injustices. Nevertheless, I try to fade away that shroud of privilege. Yes, I say _Black Lives Matter_ without uttering _all_ instead of _black_.
