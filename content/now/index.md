Y’all keep on asking what I’m, like, doing right now. Well, I’ll tell you what I’m up to, so tighten your lips and listen.

- Getting familiar with _React_, _Vue.js_, and rest of the wonderful treaties in _JavaScript_ world (backend is and will be the first love, though)
- Learning concurrent, strongly typed, and compiled languages like _Go_ and _Rust_ to balance the interpreted languages I already know well
- Occassionally taking a deep dive to functional programming with _Elixir_ since _Haskell_ was not the right one for me
- Designing and developing e-commerce services at [**Paytrail**](https://www.paytrail.com/en)
- Getting anxious about far-right reactionaries while comfortably sitting in a leftist bubble never wanting to come out
