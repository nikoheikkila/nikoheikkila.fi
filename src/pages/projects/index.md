On this page, I'm listing the open-source projects I've coded on my spare time. Contributions and issues are welcome for every project. Check the respective repositories for more information and contribution guidelines. 🙏🏽

### 👨🏻‍💻 Own Projects

These projects I've been hacking on my spare time for my account(s).

* [**nikoheikkila.fi**][blog] – the blog you're reading at the moment built with [_Gatsby_][gatsby].
* [**cv**][cv] – My professional resume page forked from a template also made with [_Gatsby_][gatsby].
* [**go-link-health**][linkhealth] – a CLI tool built with Golang for scraping the webpage for any dead links.
* [**setup**][setup] – an omnipotent Bash script for setting up a new development box.
* [**py-weather**][weather] – a small Python CLI tool for weather monitoring. Because developers won't look out of the window for checking the weather.
* [**git-flight-rules**][flightrules] – a typeset PDF book for surviving version control with Git, original material written by **Kate Hudson** and contributors.

### 📚 Archive

Projects owned by me or someone else whose unfortunate destiny has been a premature burial in the graveyard of open-source.

* [**pwnedapi**][pwnedapi] – a small Python 3 library for accessing the _Have I Been Pwned_ database for vulnerable passwords. Archived due to maintenance costs.
