Recently I ended a long relationship with *Twitter*, and I'm relieved.

For over 10 years I've written to a platform for which the experience, safety, and justice of users is irrelevant. For reasons well understood, people can't stop using it and arguing about how to use it. This is a product that never improves, that defends harmful content, and makes people unhappy. But there is money in it. A lot of money. In fact, their entire business depends on users but they never listen to them. I knew it wasn't good for me but I couldn't stop either.

When a new wave of federated social networks (or "fediverse") spearheaded by *[Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org)* solidified itself, I saw my chance to be someone who could live a better life online. Because I know the platform I'm contributing to won't be actively destroying other people's lives. Unlike Twitter, Mastodon instances are built and moderated *by* users *for* users without business incentives which makes them better in every way.

So as of today, I will no longer update my Twitter account. It's going to be hard and I might have regrets which means I won't delete my account yet. Instead, I've set up a [*cross-posting* bridge](https://crossposter.masto.donte.com.br/) from my English Mastodon account to Twitter. Don't bother replying to me because I won't be logging in to check my mentions anymore.

If you're interested in my content, here's a list of social accounts I'm still active in addition to this blog:

- [*DEV.to*](https://dev.to/nikoheikkila) for my longer posts of which most appear on this blog as well.
- [*Instagram*](https://www.instagram.com/nikoheikkila/) for all the photos I take until I figure out a better place to host them.
- [*mastodon.technology*](https://mastodon.technology/@nikoheikkila) for my short posts in English.
- [*mastodontti.fi*](https://mastodontti.fi/@nikoheikkila) for my short posts in Finnish.

I'm also on *Facebook* and *LinkedIn*. However, those accounts are more restricted, so if I have no idea who you are I'm going to decline your request. I welcome you to follow me on the sites above because I'm certain my best content is still ahead of me.

Yours Sincerely,

***Niko Heikkilä***

*P.S. This is not as dramatic a decision as it reads. I'm only channeling my inner Don Draper.*
