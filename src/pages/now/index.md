Y’all keep on asking what I’m, like, doing right now.
Well, I’ll tell you what I’m up to, so tighten your lips and listen.

- Getting familiar with _React_, _Vue.js_, and rest of the wonderful treaties in _JavaScript_ world (backend is and will be first love, though)
- Occassionally taking a deep dive to functional programming — tried _Haskell_ (nope!) so focus of today is _Elixir_
- Designing and developing e-payment solutions at **Paytrail**
- Getting anxious about far-right reactionaries while comfortably sitting in a leftist bubble never wanting to come out
