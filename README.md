My personal blog. Forked from Gatsby Blog Starter template and inspired here and there by Dan Abramov's blog.

## üîß Installation & Usage

### Environment

Gatsby makes use of several environment variables which are documented in `.env.example` file. Before building the project make sure to modify these variables as needed. Then copy the `.env.example` as `.env.development` to project root for Gatsby to recognize it.

### 1. Build Locally with Yarn

To run the build locally, type like so:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.development
yarn
yarn dev
```

### 2. Build Locally with Netlify

Alternatively, you can mimic the production environment from Netlify like so:

```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
ntl dev
```

This will download and execute a Netlify builder running the `gatsby develop` command.

Finally, open <http://localhost:8000> to view the blog.

## ü§ñ Run tests

Project is packaged with Prettier formatter, AVA unit tests, Playwright automated tests, and Pa11y accessibility tests. They can be ran respectively like so:

```sh
yarn lint
yarn test:unit
yarn test:dev
yarn test:a11y
```
